# passwd-strength
This Python script assesses the strength of a given password based on several criteria. Here’s a brief description:

**Criteria for a Strong Password:**<br>
The password must be at least 8 characters long.<br>
It should contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character.<br>
**Password Strength Assessment:**<br>
The script checks the password against the criteria and calculates a score based on how many criteria are met.<br>
It then classifies the password strength as “Strong,” “Moderate,” or “Weak” based on the score.<br>
**Feedback and Suggestions:**<br>
Depending on the strength, the script provides feedback to the user.<br>
If the password is not strong, it gives specific suggestions on how to improve it, such as adding more characters, including uppercase letters, digits, or special characters.<br>
**Example Usage:**<br>
The script includes an example password (“Abcd@1234”) and prints the strength, feedback, and suggestions for improvement<br>
