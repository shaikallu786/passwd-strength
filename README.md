# passwd-strength
This Python script assesses the strength of a given password based on several criteria. Here’s a brief description:

**Criteria for a Strong Password:**
The password must be at least 8 characters long.
It should contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character.
**Password Strength Assessment:**
The script checks the password against the criteria and calculates a score based on how many criteria are met.
It then classifies the password strength as “Strong,” “Moderate,” or “Weak” based on the score.
**Feedback and Suggestions:**
Depending on the strength, the script provides feedback to the user.
If the password is not strong, it gives specific suggestions on how to improve it, such as adding more characters, including uppercase letters, digits, or special characters.
**Example Usage:**
The script includes an example password (“Abcd@1234”) and prints the strength, feedback, and suggestions for improvement
